# ABOUT THE CREATE_AT

## The .isoformat() method generates a timestamp in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-03-22T16:06:50.489"

## By adding "Z", we explicitly indicate that the time is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

## A lambda function in Python is an anonymous, single-line function. Itâ€™s useful for delaying execution, short inline operations, and avoiding unnecessary function definitions.
